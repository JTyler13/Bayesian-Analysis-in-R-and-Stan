# What is this site for?

This site walks through examples from 4 different textbooks:

-   BDA (3^rd^ Edition)

-   Statistical Rethinking (2^nd^ Edition)

-   Doing Bayesian Data Analysis (2^nd^ Edition)

-   Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models (1^st^ Edition)

# Why is it a bit of a mess?

In an attempt to create resources while brushing up on material, these pages will initially read like a series of Bayesian rants. In due course, as I become better at Quarto, Stan and general coherence, these pages could well end up as a teaching resource!

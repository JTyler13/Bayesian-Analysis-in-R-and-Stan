In due course, as I become better at Quarto, Stan and general coherence, these pages could well end up as a teaching resource!\n\n\nBugs, Issues & Feedback\nIf you find any issues or would like to see the github repository for this site, click on the github logo by the search bar in the top right and follow the options.\nMy website is here to get in contact in more traditional ways.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top",
